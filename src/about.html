    <p class="m-8">
    Since childhood I have been fascinated by budgerigars. My first
    budgerigars were 4 Lutinos, a gift from my uncle in 1967.
    Unfortunately they all died after two weeks. They were too young and
    didn’t want to eat! I was inconsolable!
    </p>
    <p class="m-8">
    In the 80’s I started my first bloodline with birds from:
    </p>
    <ul class="m-8 leading-loose">
    <li>Holland: Brothers Peters, Van der Toren, Wolfs.</li>
    <li>England: Benneth, Humphries, Sellen, Savory</li>
    <li>Germany: Mannes ,Boggering, Efferts</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="m-8">
    The birds bred very well and soon I became a champion breeder.
    </p>

    class="h-32 m-8 mx-auto"
    />
    <p class="m-8">My best results are:</p>
    <ul class="m-8 leading-loose">
    <li>1998 Europashau Karlsruhe Germany: Best young spangle</li>
    <li>1999 NPC Holland: Best in show, opposite sex</li>
    <li>2000 BSH Holland: Best in show, millennium show</li>
    <li>2003 NGC Holland: Best in show, best adult</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="m-8">
    Unfortunately I became sick in 2008.... but after a stop of 6 years,
    I am now building a new bloodline.
